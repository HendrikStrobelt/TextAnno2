    <h2> Perceptually Ranking Text Highlighting Techniques</h2>

    <p class="p4"><b>Task: </b>You will click on highlighted text, repeatedly, within a set time limit (15 sec). Each click requires <b>precision</b>, and you must click <b>as many as possible within the time</b>. This task will be repeated several times (12 tests). Each successful click increases your point score, while false answers decrease your point score. Goal is to reach a high score. The HIT should not take more than 10 minutes in total.</p>

    <p><b>The procedure: </b>
    <ul>
      <li> <b>Important:</b> Test the system <a href="https://textanno.meteor.com/userTest" target="_blank">here</a>. You should see the start button without scrolling.</li>
      <li> Read and agree to the consent form.</li>
      <li> Provide demographic information.</li>
      <li> Take the test and have some fun. Be PRECISE and fast!! </li>
      <li> Get paid.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p><b>The system: </b> Here you see some screenshots of the test system:</p>

    <table>
        <tr style="border:dotted 1px">
            <td><img src="screenshot_1.png" width="600px"/></td><td> The gray box contains the non-sensical text with some words highlighted, that should be clicked. As soon as a word is clicked it gets gray (see 'metus'). Above the box you see an example text using the current highlighting technique.</td>

        </tr>
        <tr style="border:dotted 1px">
            <td><img src="screenshot_2.png" width="600px"/></td><td>The result page after each test gives you your statistics. Before starting the next test, you should check the text line above the gray box for what will be the next highlighting technique (in this case double underlined text).</td>
