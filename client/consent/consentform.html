    <p class="p4">Researcher: Hendrik Strobelt, PhD – Harvard SEAS</p>

    <p class="p1"><b>Participation is voluntary.</b></p>
    <p class="p4">It is your choice whether or not you wish to participate in this research. If you choose to participate, you can change your mind and leave the study at any time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Refusal to participate, or stopping your participation, will involve no penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.</p>

    <p class="p1"><b>What is the purpose of this research?</b></p>
    <p class="p4">The purpose of this research is to find out which electronic text highlighting techniques perform best across participants.</p>

    <p class="p1"><b>For how long will I take part in this research?</b></p>
    <p class="p4">Your participation will take approximately 30-40 minutes. You are only allowed to participate <i>once</i> in this study.</p>

    <p class="p1"><b>What can I expect if I take part in this research?</b></p>
    <p class="p4">You will click on highlighted text, repeatedly, within a set time limit. Each click requires precision, and you must click as many as possible within the time. This task will be repeated several times. Each successful click increases your point score, while false answers decrease your point score.</p>

    <p class="p1"><b>What are the risks and possible discomforts?</b></p>
    <p class="p4">There is minimal risk to participating in this study. You may feel uncomfortable performing the tasks under time constraints. The information you provide is anonymous and you are free to withdraw from participation at any time.</p>

    <p class="p1"><b>Are there any benefits from being in this research study?</b></p>
    <p class="p4">We do not expect any direct benefits to you from taking part in this research. One indirect benefit of participating might be knowing that you helped researchers better understand how people perceive highlighting in electronic texts.</p>
